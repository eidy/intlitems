Translate Item Texts
--------------------
This mod acts as a fast way of overriding the item texts of ALL mods in a minetest game (including defaults) in one place.

Need to get your game translated to another language in a hurry?

Do you use mods that don't support inttlib?

Perhaps this is the mod for you!

To create a template:

1. Place this mod in your game's mods folder
2. Set this option in minetest.conf

	writeintlitemstemplate = true

3. Run up your minetest game

5. Execute this command:

/writeintlitemstemplate

This will create a "template.txt", which can be used to create translation files in your chosen language...



Depends on:
intllib
